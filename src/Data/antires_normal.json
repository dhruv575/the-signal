I was recruited to the track team at Penn, so the summer before college, I recommitted myself to running in an effort to regain my identity as an athlete. Coming back to the sport after so much change was the hardest thing I've ever done, and it taught me a lot about my own grit and perseverance. It wasn't a fairytale ending",

I will never forget the steady hum of the ventilator strapped to her face and the metronomic beat of her heart monitor that suffocated the room. Miraculously, my grandmother recovered. Her presence also feels familiar: she is a proud Penn alum who returned to campus last semester to speak with students about her path as a Jewish woman immigrating from Egypt. Her recovery made me understand how so much could change so quickly. I realized that I no longer wanted to solely define myself by my studies, grades, or resume. So I didn't. "
