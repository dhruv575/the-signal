We want to encourage people to learn from their failures and to celebrate the things about themselves that arenâ€™t linked to traditional measures of success."

They will then be prompted to discuss their responses. We aim to uncover the diverse beliefs within an individualized group, and to break down stereotypes in the process."

In the visualization, bands of varying width represent the number of students that entered a certain field each year. The purpose was to find out what students of each school did at their jobs and summer internships and whether or not preconceptions about the 'most popular industries' were true. The resulting product showed a surprising amount of diversity in the paths chosen by students, with the largest bands in each school being Other, indicating that there are many more students that pursue less mainstream paths than expected. We shared these results with the Penn community in the hopes of providing students with more insight and background while they consider future professional opportunities."
