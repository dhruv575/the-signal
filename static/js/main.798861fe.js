My world came crashing down and I stopped doing everything that I loved, including running. My body began changing rapidly---I gained 25 pounds and got my period for the first time. I was recruited to the track team at Penn, so the summer before college, I recommitted myself to running in an effort to regain my identity as an athlete. Coming back to the sport after so much change was the hardest thing I\'ve ever done, and it taught me a lot about my own grit and perseverance. It wasn\'t a fairytale ending","I never got back to how fast I was in high school. But PRs and times are arbitrary representations of who we believe we really are. I only ran one race in the stripes, and while I remember my time, I\'m proud of the courage I had to show up, stand on the line, and finish my race."],"other":[],"email":"samcgreen1717@gmail.com","name":"Samantha Green","class":"2023","type":"senior","shortBio":"Samantha is graduating from the College with a B.A. in Economics and a minor in Political Science.

The purpose was to find out what students of each school did at their jobs and summer internships and whether or not preconceptions about the \'most popular industries\' were true. The resulting product showed a surprising amount of diversity in the paths chosen by students, with the largest bands in each school being Other, indicating that there are many more students that pursue less mainstream paths than expected.
